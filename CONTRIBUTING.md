## How to Find a Task (Issue)

To find a taks, just go to the Issues sections and find something you can contribute for. If you are beginning, try the "good first issue" tagged issues.

### Issues Labels

This project has a set of labels that can be described and visualized at [this link](https://github.com/kyronsatt/o-clock/labels). You can understand the goal of each label and use appropriately.

You are free to suggest [enhancement issues](https://github.com/kyronsatt/o-clock/labels/enhancement) (feature addition or improvement), but try to prioritize the [bug issues](https://github.com/kyronsatt/o-clock/labels/bug), that are urgent.

### Enhancement Issues and Backlog

Aiming to keep the original vision and UX guidelines for the project, if you create an enhancement issue, you should provide a visual representation of it, like a print or prototype of the goal feature. In addition, this type of change should be firstly approved by the code owners before be started.

So, if you create a enhancement issue, keep on mind that it should be reviewed by someone before you start your development.

To control this flow, we have a project called [**"O'Clock Backlog"**](https://github.com/kyronsatt/o-clock/projects?query=is%3Aopen++O%27Clock+Backlog), which classify enhancement issues in 4 stages:

- Need review: issues that need to be reviewd by a code owner (here is where you should put your enhancement suggestion issue).
- Ready: issues already reviewed and ready to be developed.
- In progress: issues in development process (check).
- Done: issues merged and available in production environment.

_**Remember: all enhancement issues should be added to the "Need review" category of the Backlog project.**_
